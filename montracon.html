        <h2>Refrigerated Trailer Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>
             Montracon LTD (Market Weighton) is a leading manufacturer of refrigerated trailers at both 13.5m and 9m lengths plus cold stores. 
             My immediate role there was as a machinist operating a beam saw which trimmed the panels for the trailers' sides, roofs and floors to the correct length and width. My last role before taking redundancy was as a panel trimmer which involved trimming the likes of bulkheads and doors with hand tools such as circular saws.
