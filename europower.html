        <h1>Europower Hydraulics LTD</h1>
        <h2>Engineering Experience</h2>
        <p>
            At Europower Hydraulics LTD, I gained extensive experience working as, at first, a machine operator before moving on to machine tool setting.
            This was where I set the tooling for the Wickman Multi-spindle automatic lathes and achieved high standards of accuracy for customers such as
            JCB, Rolls Royce, Terex and other important OEM'S. Europower was an ISO 9001 accredited company and quality was paramount in everything we did and working to strict 
            tolerances was not only expected, but required to keep our customers happy and their customers safe! My last position with Europower was as a Machine Cycles Engineer.
            A multi-facited role where I was responsible for running production cycles, quality control and liaising with cutomers and industry reps as well
            Continuous improvements and innovations.
