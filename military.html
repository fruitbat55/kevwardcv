            <p>
                My time at DSMT (Normandy Barracks, Leconfield, Beverley, East Yorkshire) was indeed varied with my experience there being  multi-role and working in different departments. My main role as a trainee vehicle mechanic was
                to learn the skills required to maintain and repair a wide range of military vehicles, from light utility vehicles to heavy armoured trucks. 
                My mainstay was the paint shop where we would prepare and paint vehicles to ensure they were protected from the elements and camouflaged for operational use.
                 This involved tasks such as sanding, priming, and applying paint using spray guns. We would also repair and repaint accident damaged vehicles, restoring them to serviceable condition.
