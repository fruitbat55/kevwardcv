        <h2>Security, Cleaning and Caretaking (soft Services)</h2>
        <p>
             Fallow Management provided the building management industry with soft services such as, security, cleaning and caretaking.
             my place of work was Brunswick Point, a former Yorkshire Bank building situated in the city of Leeds. I was initially employed as the buildings 
             caretaker, responsible for the overall basic maintenance and then, once I passed my SIA training course, I picked up reception and general security
             duties as well as my caretaking role. As the caretaker, I was also the cleaning manager looking after a small team of cleaners.
