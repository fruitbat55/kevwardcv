                The idea of design and creativity I find intreguing and both rewarding and frustrating. In graphic design, projects are called 'a problem'. I dont mind a problem as I enjoy issue solving. This particular venture, website design, I am still learning and I have to say I am enjoying the challenge massively and working towards accreditation as well as a strong portfolio.
